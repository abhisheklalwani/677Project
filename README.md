Please find the instructions below for testing the implementation.

# Instructions 

1. Change directory to /src
2. Execute the run_me testcase file with `python run_me.py`

  
 # Expected Output
 
 1. All the java files will be compiled 
 2. Once compilation is successful, all testcases are run sequentially
 3. Each test case runs for approximately 30 seconds, during which the transactions keep happening and seller restocks items when it runs out
 4. In each testcase, all transactions are logged in files seperated on the basis of test cases and displayed as output
